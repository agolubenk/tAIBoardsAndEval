# aiBoards

Task boards for mixed human / AI-agent teams — a focused fork of [Kaneo](https://github.com/usekaneo/kaneo) (MIT).

On top of upstream it adds:

- **Agent identity on the board** — each card shows which agent/session works it (migration `0076`).
- **SSR board snapshots** — server-rendered read-only boards with a nightly push job (migration `0077`), plus `ssr-tools` MCP tools.
- **Forest pulse** — an agents' feed / pulse panel over board activity.
- **Notebook card sources** and a `notebook_search` MCP tool.
- **Workspace-scoped API keys** — one key is limited to one workspace; workspaces are presented as «Продукты» in RU.
- RU as a first-class product language.
