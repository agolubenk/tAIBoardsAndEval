# Pipeline & evolution settings per product

> **Status (2026-11-01):** implemented. Spec rows: R-110, AC-028 (`t-boards-spec.md`). Owner's request of 01.11:
> each product's settings must be able to manage the evolution process and the pipeline, and switch the automated
> part on and off. Source of truth for the list: `packages/permissions/src/pipeline-toggles.ts`.

A product is a workspace (R-002). Its settings page **Pipeline & evolution**
(`/dashboard/settings/workspace/pipeline`) has three parts:

- a master switch, *Automated process*: off stops everything at once and keeps each switch's value;
- *Evolution of the process*;
- *Automatic parts of the pipeline*.

People with the workspace's `manage_settings` permission (owner, admin) change the switches. Members, agents and
API keys of the workspace can read them but never change them, so automation cannot widen its own rights.

## Switches and where each is enforced

A switch is listed only if something actually obeys it. Every enforcement point treats a missing or failed read
of the settings as **on**. The exception is the layer: there, the last known values stay in effect.

| Switch | Group | Off means | Enforced in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `abJudge` | evolution | `ab.py` makes no model calls for A/B comparisons (exit 3) | `eval/evolve/ab.py` |
| `askOnce` | evolution | `ask_once.py check` returns "ask as usual" without looking up | `eval/tools/ask_once.py` |
| `handoffDupes` | evolution | no duplicate-context check before a successor starts | `eval/tools/spawn_session.sh` |
| `promptBrief` | pipeline | no GLM brief of long prompts (one model call per prompt saved) | `.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.py` |
| `successorAuto` | pipeline | no automatic successor at 80 % of the window | `.claude/hooks/context-threshold.py` |
| `grillHint` | pipeline | no `<grill-task-auto>` reminder on new tasks (the rule to roast large tasks stays) | `.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.py` |
| `nerveWakes` | pipeline | Nerve still journals events but wakes nobody | `eval/nerve/nerve.py` |
| `swarm` | pipeline | `swarm.py ask` refuses to call a model (exit 3); the session does the job itself | `eval/swarm/swarm.py` |
| `councilReview` | pipeline | the council worker takes no review of cards on review (its own `worker_enabled` still applies too) | `infra/ai-council/council_worker.py` |
| `cardAutofill` | pipeline | an agent's move no longer fills assignee and start date; the move's comment and link still go out | `apps/api/src/forest/card-fill/fill-card.ts` (server) |

Repository gates (`infra/checks`, CI) are not switches. A red check is a defect, not a preference.

## How the layer reads them

The API has two routes:
- `GET /api/pipeline-settings/workspace/{workspaceId}`: members and the workspace's API keys;
- `PUT /api/pipeline-settings/workspace/{workspaceId}`: a user session with `manage_settings`. The body is a
  partial `{automation?, toggles?}`, and an unknown switch is a 400.

Storage is the table `workspace_pipeline_setting`: one JSON row per workspace, migration `0080`. No row means
every default (all on).

Hooks and tools call `.claude/scripts/pipeline_settings.py` (stdlib).

- **Source.** It reads the board, at most once every 10 minutes, using three things:
  - the board's address: `T_BOARDS_URL` from your environment, or `boards.url` in `eval/nerve/config.json`; https,
    with plain http only to localhost. An address from the repository is used only for a trusted host: the known
    board host, localhost, or `T_BOARDS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` from your own environment. A pull request that changes the
    address cannot redirect the key;
  - the product: found by itself. It is the one product the key reaches; with several, the one named in
    `boards.product` / `T_BOARDS_PRODUCT` (the name or slug people see). An id in `boards.workspace` /
    `T_BOARDS_WORKSPACE` pins it;
  - the key: `T_BOARDS_API_KEY`, else Keychain through `infra/scripts/dev-ai/mcp-secret.sh`, which is the key the
    boards MCP already uses.
- **Cache.** The answer is kept in `.claude/pipeline-settings.json` (gitignored, mode 600). A cache from another
  workspace is ignored.
- **Strict answers.** Only a complete answer is accepted. Redirects are refused, so the key never goes to another
  host.
- **Failures.** A failed read keeps the last known values and is retried only after 10 minutes. So the board
  being down costs one timeout per 10 minutes, and an outage never turns back on what the owner switched off.
- **Hot paths.** The successor hook runs on every tool call. It reads the cache only, after its own cheap exits.
- **Environment.** `TAIBE_PIPELINE` can only switch parts off on top of the board: `off`, or `swarm=off,…`.
  A session cannot overrule the owner.
- **Not connected.** With no board address, product or key, the defaults apply, and the status command below
  says what is missing.

Limits: one product per checkout (the layer reads one workspace). The page keeps only the last change (who and when), with no per-switch history. An open page does not update live when someone else changes a switch.

```bash
python3 -I .claude/scripts/pipeline_settings.py          # effective switches and their source
python3 -I .claude/scripts/pipeline_settings.py fetch    # refresh now
```

## Tests

- `packages/permissions/src/pipeline-toggles.test.ts`: defaults, normalisation, the master switch.
- `tests/api-integration/pipeline-settings.test.ts`:
  - defaults and partial updates;
  - agents, keys and members get 403 on update;
  - an unknown switch gets 400;
  - with `cardAutofill` off, no fields are filled and the comment is still posted.
- `.claude/scripts/test_pipeline_settings.py`:
  - the keys match the TypeScript list;
  - environment override, cache, fetch from a fake board;
  - an outage keeps the last known values; a broken cache falls back to defaults.
